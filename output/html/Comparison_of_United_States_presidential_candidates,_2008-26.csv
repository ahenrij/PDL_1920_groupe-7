John McCain,,Barack Obama,
"John McCain believes that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental, individual Constitutional right. In the past he has voted to protect gun manufacturers from attempts to make them liable for crimes committed by third parties. McCain opposes restrictions on assault rifles and has voted against such bans. He has supported legislation requiring gun manufacturers to include gun safety devices such as trigger locks in product packaging. He cosponsored legislation to lift the DC gun ban. McCain opposed "waiting periods" for the purchase of firearms.[177] McCain also voted against the 1993 Brady Bill to restrict the availability of handguns.[178]",,"During a February 15, 2008 press conference, Obama stated, "I think there is an individual right to bear arms, but it's subject to commonsense regulation."[citation needed] He supports the right of local municipalities to determine gun laws.[179][180] Obama has also stated that he will work to reintroduce the expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban and to make it permanent.[181] In Illinois, he backed changes to state law that included a ban on assault weapons sales and limiting handgun sales to one a month. In Congress, he voted to leave gun-makers and dealers open to lawsuits for actions committed by third parties.[182][183] Obama has proposed outlawing types of ammunition.[184]",
