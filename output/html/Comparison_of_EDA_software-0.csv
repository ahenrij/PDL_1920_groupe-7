Name,Architecture,License,Autorouter,Comment
Electric,"*BSD, Java",GPL,Yes,VLSI circuit design tool with connectivity at all levels. Can also be used for schematic entry and PCB design.
FreePCB,w32,GPL,Yes,"A printed circuit board design program for Microsoft Windows. FreePCB allows for up to 16 copper layers, both metric and US customary units, and export of designs in Gerber format. Boards can be partially or fully autorouted with the FreeRouting[10] autorouter by using the FpcROUTE Specctra DSN design file translator."
Fritzing,"Windows, Mac, Linux",GPL,Yes,"Protoboard view, schematic view, PCB view, Code (firmware) view. Includes customizable design rule checker. Includes common shaped boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi shields. Allows spline curve traces. Only two layers (top and bottom). Outputs gerbers."
gEDA,"*BSD, Linux, Mac",GPL,Yes,"schematic, simulation, PCB editor, gerber view"
Gnucap,any (C++98),GPL3,No,Mixed-signal circuit simulator
Icarus Verilog,"*BSD, Linux, Mac",GPL,No,Verilog simulator

Verilator,Posix,GPL,No,"Verilator is the fastest free Verilog HDL simulator. It compiles synthesizable Verilog into cycle accurate C++ or SystemC code following 2-state synthesis (zero delay) semantics. Benchmarks reported on its website suggest it is several times faster than commercial event driven simulators such as ModelSim, NC-Verilog and VCS, while not quite as fast as commercial cycle accurate modeling tools such as Carbon ModelStudio and ARC VTOC."
XCircuit,Unix,GPL,No,Used to produce netlists and publish high-quality drawings.
