John McCain,,Barack Obama,
"In 2004, McCain voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, arguing that each state should be able to choose whether to recognize same-sex marriages.[161][162] He supported the 2006 Arizona initiative to ban same-sex marriage.[163]",,"Obama voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment which would have defined marriage as between one man and one woman, but personally believes that marriage is a religious bond between a man and a woman. He supports civil unions for same-sex couples which would be same-sex marriage in all but name, but believes that decisions about the name marriage should be left to the states.[164][165][166]",
Chuck Baldwin,Bob Barr,Cynthia McKinney,Ralph Nader
