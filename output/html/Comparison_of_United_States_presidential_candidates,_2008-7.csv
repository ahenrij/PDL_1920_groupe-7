Wade."[173] While serving in the Illinois Senate, Obama voted against bills that included partial birth abortion bans.

She rejects forced, coerced, or uninformed medication and sterilization, and supports single-payer universal healthcare.[175]","Nader is opposed to legal restrictions on abortion, "I don't think government has the proper role in forcing a woman to have a child or forcing a woman not to have a child... This is something that should be privately decided with the family, woman, all the other private factors of it, but we should work toward preventing the necessity of abortion."[176]"
