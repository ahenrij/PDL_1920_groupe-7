John McCain,,Barack Obama,
<<<<<<< HEAD
"In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on April 23, 2002, McCain said that "no American leader should be expected to sell a false peace to our ally, consider Israel's right to self-defense less legitimate than ours, or insist that Israel negotiate a political settlement while terrorism remains the Palestinians' preferred bargaining tool."[84]",,"Obama supports a two-state solution.[85] Referring to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in January 2006, Obama denounced Hamas while praising former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. At a meeting with then Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on the eve of Hamas' sweeping election victory,[86] Obama stated that Sharon's role in the conflict had always been "absolutely important and constructive."[citation needed]",

"McCain favors tax credits of up to $5,000 for families that purchase health insurance.[36] "We do not believe in coercion and the use of state power to mandate care, coverage or costs."[36] His plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 1 million by 2009 and 5 million by 2013, while raising the national debt by $1.3 trillion over 10 years, according to one estimate.[37]",,"Obama's health care plan includes implementing guaranteed eligibility for affordable health care for all Americans.[38] His plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 18 million by 2009 and 34 million by 2018, covering nearly all children, while raising the national debt by $1.6 trillion over 10 years, according to one estimate.[39]",

Believes Medicare and Medicaid are financially unstable, and "need to be transformed to emphasize patient choice, focus on the truly needy, and add cost-saving incentives."[40]","Co-sponsored every bill in Congress to create a system of universal health care under a single payer model. Opposes forced, coerced, or uninformed medication and sterilization; believes Americans should be able to purchase drugs from other countries if the price is cheaper, and the U.S. should negotiate with drug companies to provide cheaper drugs for all U.S. residents.[34]",Nader supports a universal single-payer health care system and full Medicare for everyone.[41]
