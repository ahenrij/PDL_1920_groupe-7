Algorithm,Output size (bits),Internal state sizeThe internal state here means the "internal hash sum" after each compression of a data block. Most hash algorithms also internally use some additional variables such as length of the data compressed so far since that is needed for the length padding in the end. See the Merkle–Damgård construction for details.,Block size,Length size,Word size,Rounds
BLAKE2b,512,512,1024,"128The size of BLAKE2b's message length counter is 128-bit, but it counts message length in bytes, not in bits like the other hash functions in the comparison. It can hence handle eight times longer messages than a 128-bit length size would suggest (one byte equaling eight bits). A length size of 131-bit is the comparable length size (8 \times 2^{128 = 2^{131).",64,12
BLAKE2s,256,256,512,"64The size of BLAKE2s's message length counter is 64-bit, but it counts message length in bytes, not in bits like the other hash functions in the comparison. It can hence handle eight times longer messages than a 64-bit length size would suggest (one byte equaling eight bits). A length size of 67-bit is the comparable length size (8 \times 2^{64 = 2^{67).",32,10
BLAKE3,Unlimited,"256The full BLAKE3 incremental state includes a chaining value stack up to 1728 bytes in size. However, the compression function itself does not access this stack. A smaller stack can also be used if the maximum input length is restricted.",512,64,32,7

RadioGatún,"UnlimitedRadioGatún is an Extendable-Output Function which means it has an output of unlimited size. The official test vectors are 256-bit hashes. RadioGatún claims to have the security level of a cryptographic sponge function 19 words in size, which means the 32-bit version has the security of a 304-bit hash when looking at preimage attacks, but the security of a 608-bit hash when looking at collision attacks. The 64-bit version, likewise, has the security of a 608-bit or 1216-bit hash. For the purposes of determining how vulnerable RadioGatún is to length extension attacks, only two words of its 58-word state are output between hash compression operations.",58 words,"19 wordsRadioGatún is not a Merkle–Damgård construction and, as such, does not have a block size. Its belt is 39 words in size; its mill, which is the closest thing RadioGatún has to a "block", is 19 words in size.",–,1–64Only the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of RadioGatún have official test vectors,"18The 18 blank rounds are only applied once in RadioGatún, between the end of the input mapping stage and before the generation of output bits"
