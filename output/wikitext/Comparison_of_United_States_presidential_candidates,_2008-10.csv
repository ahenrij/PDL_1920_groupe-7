John McCain,,Barack Obama,
<<<<<<< HEAD
"In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on April 23, 2002, McCain said that "no American leader should be expected to sell a false peace to our ally, consider Israel's right to self-defense less legitimate than ours, or insist that Israel negotiate a political settlement while terrorism remains the Palestinians' preferred bargaining tool."[84]",,"Obama supports a two-state solution.[85] Referring to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in January 2006, Obama denounced Hamas while praising former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. At a meeting with then Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on the eve of Hamas' sweeping election victory,[86] Obama stated that Sharon's role in the conflict had always been "absolutely important and constructive."date=April 2011",

,,"US should stop weapons transfers to Middle East countries, including Israel—and be "honest broker." In terms of two- versus one-state solution, would listen to the voices and human rights advocates who are there.[87]","Nader supports the Israeli peace movement and views resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as central to national security.[88][89] Nader was critical of the US-supported bombing of Lebanon in 2006, seeing it as collective punishment.[88] Nader wants enforcement of UN resolutions concerning Israel and a peaceful two-state solution.[88]"

Members of the McCain camp have pointed out that George Bush signed a federal directive in 2001 that outlawed racial profiling and ordered the Attorney General to look into the matter.[201],,"Obama wants to eliminate racial profiling by federal law enforcement agencies.[202] As state senator in Illinois, Obama helped bring about passage of the state’s first racial-profiling law.[203] In October 2007, he asked Attorney General-Designate, Judge Michael Mukasey, to end the practice.[204]",

,,"McKinney supports comprehensive federal investment in low-come families and communities, with an emphasis on people of color, to eliminate racial and other disparities in education, healthcare, imprisonment, family income, wealth, home ownership. She supports a moratorium on foreclosures, and end to the privatization of prisons. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita survivors should be recognized as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs); she supports protecting their right of return, including their right to vote in their home states, and reparations for the losses they incurred due to government abandonment and negligence. She calls for an end to the "War on Drugs," which justifies foreign military intervention and assaults civil liberties; mandatory minimum drug sentences should be ended, and the budget should focus on treatment and prevention.[25]",
