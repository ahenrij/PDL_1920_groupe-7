Bidule,"Mac OS X, Windows",C++,C++,ASIO/ CoreAudio (Mac)/ ReWire support. Possible to write custom modules via API if NDA accepted.
ChucK,"Mac OS X, Linux, Windows",C++,,"Unified timing mechanism (no separation between audio-rate and control-rate), command-line access"
Csound,"Mac OS X, Linux, Windows","C, C++","C; also Python, Java, Lisp, Lua, Tcl, C++","IDE (QuteCsound), multitrack interface (blue); several analysis/resynthesis facilities; can compute double-precision audio; Python and LuaJIT algorithmic composition library; multi-threaded processing"
Impromptu,Mac OS X,"Lisp, Objective-C, Scheme","C, C++, Objective-C, Scheme","Native access to most OS X APIs including Core Image, Quartz, QuickTime and OpenGL. Impromptu also includes its own statically typed (inferencing) systems language for heavy numeric processing - OpenGL, RT AudioDSP etc.."
