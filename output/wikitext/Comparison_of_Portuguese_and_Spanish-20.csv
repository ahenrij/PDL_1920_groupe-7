Spelling,Pronunciation,,Notes
,Spanish,Portuguese,
b,[b ~ ?],[b ~ ?] (EP) [b] (BP),In Spanish and European Portuguese /b/ is lenited after a continuant.
d,[d ~ ğ],[d ~ ğ] (EP) [d ~ d?] (BP),"In Spanish and European Portuguese /d/ is lenited after a continuant. In all Portuguese dialects, the consonants /t/ and /d/ have affricate allophones, happening when before a palatalizing /i/ ([d?i ~ d?i], [t?i ~ t?i], mainly in Brazil), or an elided /?/ ~ /e?/ ~ /?/ or unstressed /i/ before another (that actually becomes /?/ in Portugal), stressed one, leading to sandhi ([dVz] ? dz, [dVs] ? ts, [tVs] ? [ts], both in Brazil and Portugal)."
t,[t],[t] (EP) [t ~ t?] (BP),
g,[? ~ ?],[? ~ ?] (EP) [?] (BP),In Spanish and European Portuguese /?/ is lenited after a continuant.
-l,[l],[?] (EP) [w] (BP),"In European Portuguese syllable-final /l/ is velarized ? as in Catalan (see dark l), while in most Brazilian dialects and some rural European ones it is vocalized to w. Caipira rhoticizes to English-like ar, while portunhol da pampa velarizes it."
"r-, -rr-",[r],[?],"In Portuguese, r- and -rr- have several possible pronunciations. In most dialects, it is a guttural r as in French ([?], [?] and [?] in Portugal and Brazil, [x], [?], [?], [h] and [?] in Brazil), while in rural northern Portugal and southern Brazil it is a trilled r r (like in Galician). In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final -r may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia), though English-like ?, ? or ? is more common, while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish, r- and -rr- have kept their original pronunciation as an alveolar trill r. Intervocalic -r- is an alveolar tap in both languages ?."
v,[b ~ ?],[v],"Originally, the letters ?b? and ?v? stood for distinct sounds pronounced b and ?, respectively, but the two eventually merged into a single phoneme in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes, and the bilabial fricative [?] of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the labiodental fricative v, as in French and Italian."
