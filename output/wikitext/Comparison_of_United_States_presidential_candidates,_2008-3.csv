John McCain,,Barack Obama,
<<<<<<< HEAD
"In October 2005, McCain, a former POW, introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005. That month, the U.S. Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment.[119] In October 2007, McCain said of waterboarding that, "They [other presidential candidates] should know what it is. It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture."[120] However, in February 2008 he voted against HR 2082, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which included provisions that would have prevented the CIA from waterboarding prisoners.",,"Obama voted against the Military Commissions Act of 2006[121] and later voted to restore habeas corpus to those detained by the U.S. (which had been stripped by the Military Commissions Act).[122] He has advocated closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but has not supported two specific bills that would have done so.[123] Obama opposes the use of torture.[124]",

,,,"Nader views CIA kidnapping and extraordinary rendition as leading to diminished respect around the world.[125] "Constitutional crimes against due process, probable cause, habeas corpus, together with torture and indefinite imprisonment... will worsen and erode American jurisprudence with serious consequences for both the nation's security and its liberties."[126]"

"McCain supported the invasion of Iraq and has stated that he would keep troops in Iraq for as long as needed, dependent on agreement from the Iraqi government. "It's not a matter of how long we're in Iraq, it's if we succeed or not."[90] John McCain was an early supporter of the Surge.",,"Obama opposed the Iraq war as early as 2002 and has pledged a responsible, phased withdrawal.[91] Obama was a strong opponent of the Surge and up until July 2008, he continued to call it a failure, in spite of a general consensus that the surge had been a success.[92] and he wrote and introduced the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007 which would have stopped the Surge and started to pull American troops out of Iraq in 2007.[93] He continues to criticize the Surge because he says it has not achieved political reconciliation, has overtaxed the military and diverted focus from Afghanistan and Pakistan, which he considers to be the central front in the War on Terror.[91]",

"Baldwin has stated that the US's involvement in Iraq is clearly unconstitutional as well as unnecessary, and would begin safely withdrawing troops.[31]","Barr considers the invasion and occupation of Iraq to have been mistakes. American presence "emboldens both insurgents and terrorists", and has cost "hundreds of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars." He supports "withdrawal without undue delay."[94]","McKinney calls for the immediate and orderly withdrawal of all US troops and contracted personnel from Iraq and Afghanistan; she would dismantle US military bases in the area, and demand that US and other international corporations relinquish any claims to Iraqi oil or other resources.[95] She has consistently opposed funding for the war and the military budget.[96]","Nader opposes the US occupation of Iraq on the grounds that “it’s the occupation that is breeding the resistance.”[97] He supports a “responsible, orderly withdrawal” within six months.[97] Following withdrawal, he supports inclusion of an international peacekeeping force under UN auspices, promotion of Iraqi self-rule through independent elections, and the providing of humanitarian aid to stabilize the country.[98]"
