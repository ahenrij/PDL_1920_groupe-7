Because this smaller memory pool uses the same connection as the 7th lane to the larger main pool, it contends with accesses to the larger block reducing the effective memory bandwidth not adding to it as an independent connection could.[70]",196.3 + 28.0name=GTX960MemoryMess,,224 + 32name=GTX960MemoryMess,58.8 65.9,109.2 122.5,3?494.4 3?920.3,109.2 122.5,145,4-way SLI,$329
