"Baldwin believes that the U.S. is not the world's policeman, and would end all foreign aid and interventionist policies.[31]",""[F]oreign aid has proved to be a drain on the U.S. economy while doing little good for the recipients. Aid is routinely used by corrupt foreign governments to oppress their people and enrich powerful elites. Foreign aid almost always discourages economic and political reform, while subsidizing nations which often work against U.S. interests."[134]",,

"In October 2005, McCain, a former POW, introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005. That month, the U.S. Senate voted 90–9 to support the amendment.[119] In October 2007, McCain said of waterboarding that, "They [other presidential candidates] should know what it is. It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture."[120] However, in February 2008 he voted against HR 2082, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which included provisions that would have prevented the CIA from waterboarding prisoners.",,"Obama voted against the Military Commissions Act of 2006[121] and later voted to restore habeas corpus to those detained by the U.S. (which had been stripped by the Military Commissions Act).[122] He has advocated closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but has not supported two specific bills that would have done so.[123] Obama opposes the use of torture.[124]",

,,,"Nader views CIA kidnapping and extraordinary rendition as leading to diminished respect around the world.[125] "Constitutional crimes against due process, probable cause, habeas corpus, together with torture and indefinite imprisonment... will worsen and erode American jurisprudence with serious consequences for both the nation's security and its liberties."[126]"
